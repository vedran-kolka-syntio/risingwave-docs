Change Data Capture (CDC) refers to the process of identifying and capturing data changes in a database, then delivering the changes to a downstream service in real time.

:::note
The supported PostgreSQL versions are 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
:::

You can ingest CDC data from PostgreSQL in two ways:

- Using the direct PostgreSQL CDC connector
    This connector is included in RisingWave. With this connector, RisingWave can connect to PostgreSQL directly to obtain data from the binlog without starting additional services.

- Using a CDC tool and the Kafka connector
    You can use the [Debezium connector for PostgreSQL](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html) and then use the Kafka connector in RisingWave to consume data from the Kafka topics.

## Using the native PostgreSQL CDC connector

### Set up PostgreSQL

#### Set up PostgreSQL locally

Ensure that the `wal_value` of your Postgres is `logical`. Check by using the following query.

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
```

By default, it will be `replica`. For CDC, you will need to set it to logical in the database configuration file (postgresql.conf) or via a psql command. The following command will change the `wal_value`.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_value = logical;
```

Keep in mind that changing the `wal_level` requires a restart of the Postgres instance and can affect database performance.

For PostgreSQL connector to work properly, you should grant the user following privileges:

- `Replication` privileges in the database to add the table to a publication.
    
    ```sql
    ALTER USER <username> REPLICATION;
    ```
    
- `CREATE` privileges on the database to add publications.
    
    ```sql
    ALTER USER <username> CREATEDB;
    ```
    
- `SELECT` privileges on the tables to copy the initial table data. Table owners automatically have `SELECT` permission for the table.

You can check your privileges by using the `\du` psql command:
```
dev-# \du
List of roles
Role name  |                        Attributes                          | Member of
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
postgres   | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS |    {}
```

#### Set up AWS RDS PostgreSQL 

Here we will use a standard class instance without Multi-AZ deployment as an example.

1. Check whether the `wal_level` parameter is set to `logical`. If it is `logical` then we are done. Otherwise, create a parameter group for your Postgres instance. We created a parameter group named **pg-cdc** for the instance that is running Postgres 12. Next, click the **pg-cdc** parameter group to edit the value of `rds.logical_replication` to 1.

2. Go to the **Databases** page and modify your instance to use the **pg-cdc** parameter group.

<img
  src={require('../images/pg-cdc-parameter.png').default}
  alt="Apply modified parameter group to pg instance"
/>

3. Click **Continue** and choose **Apply immediately**. Finally, click **Modify DB instance** to save changes. Remember to reboot the Postgres instance to put the changes into effect.

### Enable the connector node in RisingWave

The native PostgreSQL CDC connector is implemented by a connector node. A connector node handles the connections with upstream and downstream systems, and it is currently only available in RiseDev, the developer tool of RisingWave. 

### Create a materialized source connection using the native CDC connector

To ensure all data changes are captured, you must create a materialized source connection (`CREATE TABLE`) and specify primary keys. The data format must be Debezium JSON.

 #### Syntax

 ```sql
 CREATE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] source_name (
    column_name data_type PRIMARY KEY , ...
    PRIMARY KEY ( column_name, ... )
 ) 
 WITH (
    connector='postgres-cdc',
    <field>=<value>, ...
 );
 ```
 Note that a primary key is required.

 #### WITH parameters

 All the fields listed below are required. 

 |Field|Notes|
 |---|---|
 |hostname| Host name of the database. |
 |port| Port number of the database.|
 |username| User name of the database.|
 |password| Password of the database. |
 |database.name| Name of the database.|
 |schema.name| Name of the schema. |
 |table.name| Name of the table that you want to ingest data from. |
 |slot.name| The slot name for each Postgres source. Each source should have a unique slot name.|

 #### Data format

 `DEBEZIUM_JSON` — Data is in Debezium JSON format. [Debezium](https://debezium.io) is a log-based CDC tool that can capture row changes from various database management systems such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server and generate events with consistent structures in real time. The PostgreSQL CDC connector in RisingWave supports JSON as the serialization format for Debezium data. The data format does not need to be specified.


 #### Example

 ```sql
 CREATE TABLE shipments (
    shipment_id INTEGER,
    order_id INTEGER,
    origin STRING,
    destination STRING,
    is_arrived boolean,
    PRIMARY KEY (shipment_id)
) with (
 connector = 'postgres-cdc',
 hostname = '127.0.0.1',
 port = '5432',
 username = 'postgres',
 password = 'postgres',
 database.name = 'dev',
 schema.name = 'public',
 table.name = 'shipments',
 slot.name = 'shipments'
);
 ```


## Use the Debezium connector for PostgreSQL

### Set up PostgreSQL

Before using the native PostgreSQL CDC connector in RisingWave, you need to complete several configurations for PostgreSQL. For details, see [Setting up PostgreSQL](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#setting-up-postgresql). There are instructions on how to set up Postgres locally and in the cloud.

### Deploy the Debezium connector for PostgreSQL

You need to download and configure the [Debezium connector for PostgreSQL](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html), and then add the configuration to your Kafka Connect cluster. For details, see [Deployment](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-deployment) section.

### Create a materialized source using the Kafka connector

 To ensure all data changes are captured, you must create a materialized source connection (`CREATE TABLE`) and specify primary keys. The data format must be Debezium JSON. For details

 ```sql
 CREATE TABLE source_name (
    column1 VARCHAR,
    column2 INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (column1)
 ) 
 WITH (
    connector='kafka',
    topic='user_test_topic',
    properties.bootstrap.server='172.10.1.1:9090,172.10.1.2:9090',
    scan.startup.mode='earliest',
    properties.group.id='demo_consumer_name'
 );
 ```
