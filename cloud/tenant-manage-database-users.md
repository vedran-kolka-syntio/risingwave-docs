In RisingWave, a database user is similar to a database user/role in Postgres, allowing a person or application to access a specific database or set of databases within a tenant. Database users can be assigned specific permissions to control their database privileges.

:::info
In the Beta version, all users are superusers. More permission controls for creating new databases and users and login permissions will be available in future releases.
